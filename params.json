The Controller code is not complete either, since the library is not uploaded. If you are interested, use the server below. (and contact us for more info.)\r\n\r\nyou can do it yourself. Also, the server is very slow (what you are expecting from a $5 server?), so the linkme and graph function takes a lot of time. \r\n\r\n# The server\r\nhttp://162.243.27.217:3000/#/\r\n\r\n# Title Page\r\n![Alt text](/demo/hp.png?raw=true \"Optional Title\")\r\n\r\n# Home page\r\n![Alt text](/demo/home.png?raw=true \"Optional Title\")\r\n\r\n# Graph page\r\n![Alt text](/demo/graph.png?raw=true \"Optional Title\")\r\n\r\n# Matching Information\r\n![Alt text](/demo/match information.png?raw=true \"Optional Title\")\r\n\r\n# Professor Profile\r\n![Alt text](/demo/proflink.png?raw=true \"Optional Title\")\r\n\r\nUniversity Page\r\n![Alt text](/demo/university.png?raw=true \"Optional Title\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
