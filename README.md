This is the source code for LinkMyProf, a website where you can match other professors and save your interests. 
Note that it is only for CS and ECE professors, since the we have too many professors. 

It is not the complete source code since NPM, Bower, Grunt, Mongoose etc. hasn't been installed and cannot run. The Controller code is not complete either, since the library is not uploaded. If you are interested, use the server below. (and contact us for more info.)
you can do it yourself. Also, the server is very slow (what you are expecting from a $5 server?), so the linkme and graph function takes a lot of time.
